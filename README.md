# Soundboard App

## To set up the app in your local environment

1. Download all dependencies: `npm install`

2. Start the node server: `nodemon server.js`

3. On your browser go to: `localhost:8081`


## What we have so far (while very minimal at the moment):

- An app using NodeJS (Express)
- login/registration w/ weak authentication
- app is connected to a local MySQL database.
- All new users & logins use MySQL database for verification.
- logging (A lot of it).
